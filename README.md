# Analysis-on-US-Super-Store-Data
The supermarket dataset comprises a comprehensive list of categorical and continuous variables obtained from a U.S. superstore spanning the years 2014-2018. The dataset encompasses a diverse range of products, including books, toys, clothes, shoes, food, furniture, and various household items, each associated with corresponding profit values. For each item, profit is linked to specific customer IDs, locations, order dates, and ship dates. The dataset features approximately 20 columns and close to 10,000 rows.

The primary objective is to model the profits for each product within the dataset. This involves data aggregation and experimentation with multiple regression models to predict U.S. superstore profits. The models applied include decision tree, Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models are evaluated both on the entire dataset and on individual subcategories of superstore products. The analysis encompasses a holistic approach to understand and predict profit variations across different product types within the superstore dataset.
